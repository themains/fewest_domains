# Regression-Aware Domain Selection: Next Steps

## Current Status ‚úÖ
- **Problem Validated**: Domain selection introduces significant regression bias
- **Diagnostic Framework**: Can test coefficient recovery and error correlations  
- **Key Finding**: Popular domain selection creates systematic bias

## Critical Discovery üö®
**Current "optimal" methods likely introduce regression bias** because they:
1. Prioritize popular domains (like our "Popular" strategy)
2. Create systematic selection patterns that correlate with user characteristics
3. Focus on precision but ignore representativeness for regression analysis

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Test Current Methods ‚ö†Ô∏è 
- Apply our main domain optimization methods (naive, optimal, core-tail) to regression scenarios
- **Hypothesis**: They will show significant regression bias
- **Test**: Run regression_diagnostics.R with proper paths

### 2. Develop Regression-Aware Methods üîß
Need new optimization objective:
```
minimize |D| 
subject to:
  - SE(≈∑·µ¢) ‚â§ s  (precision constraint)
  - Cov(Œ¥·µ¢, X·µ¢) ‚âà 0  (unbiased regression constraint)
```

### 3. Implementation Strategy üìã
**Option A: Stratified Selection**
- Stratify by key X variables
- Ensure representative selection within each stratum
- Balance efficiency vs representativeness

**Option B: Propensity-Weighted Selection** 
- Weight domain selection by propensity to avoid bias
- Similar to causal inference matching methods
- More complex but potentially more efficient

**Option C: Multi-Objective Optimization**
- Explicit trade-off between precision and regression bias
- Pareto frontier analysis
- User chooses acceptable bias-efficiency trade-off

### 4. Validation Framework üìä
- Test across multiple X distributions
- Various Œ≤ effect sizes and patterns  
- Different domain selection intensities
- Real-world browsing pattern validation

## Research Questions ü§î

1. **How much bias do current methods introduce?** 
   - Quantify across different scenarios
   - Identify worst-case user characteristics

2. **What's the efficiency cost of regression-aware selection?**
   - Trade-off curves: domains needed vs bias reduction
   - Break-even analysis for different applications

3. **Which user characteristics matter most?**
   - Age, income, tech-savviness, privacy concerns?
   - Guide stratification strategy

4. **Can we predict bias without ground truth?**
   - Diagnostic measures for real applications
   - Early warning systems for problematic selections

## Success Metrics üìà

‚úÖ **Regression Validity**: |Œ≤ÃÇ_sampled - Œ≤ÃÇ_true| < 5% for key coefficients  
‚úÖ **Efficiency**: < 50% increase in domains vs precision-only methods  
‚úÖ **Robustness**: Works across diverse X and Œ≤ patterns  
‚úÖ **Practical**: Clear guidance for real applications

## Expected Impact üí°

This work bridges **optimal sampling** and **causal inference**, ensuring that:
- Web browsing analysis doesn't introduce selection bias
- Coefficient estimates remain valid for policy/research
- Efficiency gains don't come at cost of statistical validity
- Domain classification resources are used optimally

**Bottom Line**: Current methods optimize for precision but may invalidate downstream regression analysis. We need joint optimization for both objectives.
